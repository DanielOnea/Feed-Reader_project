# Project Overview

This project is a part of Udacity front-end nanodegree.

It is a web-application that reads RSS feeds and that uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for testing.


##  How to Run

Download the repo (https://github.com/DanielOnea/Feed-Reader_project) and  open the index.html file.
It may take some time to completely load as additional network requests are made. Once loaded, test results should apear at the bottom of the page.


##  Tests

* Tests for allFeeds has been defined and that it is not empty
* Tests for allFeeds have a url and that the url is not empty
* Tests for allFeeds have a name and that the name is not empty
* Searches for the class of 'menu-hidden' in the body tag and checks that the menu is hidden
* Toggles on click event if the menu appears or disappears
* Tests if the loadFeed function has at least a one '.entry' within the '.feed' container
* Tests to see if two entries are not equal
